Slightly modified `https://github.com/kamran-redis/redis-langchain-chatbot.git` to work with llama-2 13b and Hugging face. Only tested on Mac M1 with metal support. 
* You can use this totally offline
* A lot of innovation is happening on llama-2

  
>*Powered by [Redis](https://redis.io), [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/) *

In this tutorial we build a conversational retail shopping assistant that helps customers find items of interest that are buried in a product catalog. Our chatbot will take user input, find relevant products, and present the information in a friendly and detailed manner.

The source code here goes along with [this Redis blog post](https://redis.com/blog/build-ecommerce-chatbot-with-redis/). Try various prompt-engineering techniques to improve on this prototype for your use case!
